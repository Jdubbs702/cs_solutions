# cs_solutions

This repo contains my solutions for the computes science course I took.
It is algorithm and data structure focused and includes a variety of "real-world"
problems to solve.
Problems include solutions in C, Python, SQL...

Each problem has its own folder with a README file explaining the problem, along
with the solution in the delineated language
